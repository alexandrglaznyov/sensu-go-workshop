# This is an example of "occurrence filtering" in Sensu. Sensu occurrences are 
# a simple counter that Sensu increments for events with the same status as the 
# preceding event, and resets whenever the status changes.  Filtering on 
# occurrences will let you control the frequency of alerts and other actions 
# taken by Sensu.
# 
# The following example is only applied to events produced on a 30s interval. 
# It allows for the first occurrence of an event to be processed, and then 
# every 120th event (i.e. 120 x 30 seconds = hourly notifications).
