## Overview 

==TODO: on-demand monitoring instrumentation.
We've already been using Assets so far in our training, but they were pre-configured.== 

## Why not containers? 

==TODO: because cross-platform (Windows); 
lower-level implementation (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc) that doesn't require a pre-installed runtime (CRI).== 

## How it works

==TODO: packaging, hosting, configuration (builds, url, sha512, filters); 
Bonsai (the "Docker Hub" for Sensu Go).== 

## Advanced topics

### CLI command plugins 

### Plugin SDK 

==TODO: awareness; 
developer training (coming soon).==

## EXERCISE: register an asset 

==TODO: `sensuctl asset add`, and `sensuctl create -f` (with downloaded asset yaml from Bonsai).==

## EXERCISE: configure a custom asset

## EXERCISE: package a shell script as an asset
