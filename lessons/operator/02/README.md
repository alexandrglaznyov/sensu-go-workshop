## What is Observability?

Observability is set of practices that include traditional monitoring (i.e. observability is a superset of monitoring).
The term originated in the discipline of control systems engineering, where it is defined as a measurement of how well a system's internal states could be inferred from its external outputs.
A system is observable if its current state can be determined in a finite time period using only the outputs of the system.
Observability is achieved by collecting and analyzing events, logs, metrics, and trace data from the systems we operate.

> _NOTE: Defining the terms "monitoring" and "observability" are non-goals for this workshop.
> However, a lot has been written on this topic and some of our favorite opinions on the matter are linked in the ["Learn more"](#learn-more) section, below._
